Bdec specifications
===================

The bdec specification is machine readable, and is capable of describing
multiple existing binary formats.

    field
    sequence
    choice
    sequenceof

    reference

    expressions
    constraints


.. _bdec-entries:

There are five basic entries in a bdec protocol specification.

  * A :ref:`field <format-field>`
  * A :ref:`sequence <format-sequence>`
  * A :ref:`choice <format-choice>`
  * A :ref:`sequenceof <format-sequenceof>`
  * A :ref:`reference <format-reference>`

Once the basic entries have been mastered, there are some
:ref:`tips <format-tips>` that can be used to improve the readability of the
specification.
