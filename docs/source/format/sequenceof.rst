==================
SequenceOf entries
==================

SequenceOf entries are repeitions of another element a given number of times.
The repeated entry may be repeated a `given number of times`_, it may may
repeated `until a buffer is empty`_, or it may repeat until a `condition is
met`_.

.. _given number of times: `Count loops`_
.. _until a buffer is empty: `Length loops`_
.. _condition is met: `End-Sequenceof loops`_


Specification
=============

Bdec sequenceof entries can have 3 attributes;

  * A name (optional)
  * A count_ (optional)
  * A length_ (optional)
  * An :ref:`if <boolean-expression>` (optional)

A SequenceOf entry contains entries that are to be repeated (ie: a
:ref:`field <format-field>`, a :ref:`sequence <format-sequence>`, a sequenceof,
a :ref:`choice <format-choice>`, or a :ref:`references <format-reference>`). If
more than one entry is found, an intermediate :ref:`sequence <format-sequence>`
will be created to contain all of the child entries.

A sequenceof should have either a count, a length, or have an embedded 
`end-sequenceof`_ to indicate when to stop repeating the element. If none of
these are present, it is a greedy_ sequenceof.

.. _count: `Count loops`_
.. _length: `Length loops`_
.. _end-sequenceof: `End-sequenceof loops`_
.. _greedy: `Greedy sequenceof`_


Count loops
===========

The count attribute is an :ref:`expression <bdec-expressions>` that indicates
the number of times the embedded item should repeat.


Length loops
============

The length attribute is an :ref:`expression <bdec-expressions>` that indicates
the size of the buffer in bits. The embedded entry will be repeated until the
buffer is empty.


End-sequenceof loops
====================

By embedding an 'end-sequenceof' tag somewhere in the child, when that child
item is decoded, the sequenceof will end. This is useful when loops are 
terminated with an 'end' tag in the buffer. It is usually used with a 
:ref:`choice <format-choice>` entry.

For example, a `null terminated string`_ can be defined by a sequence of 
characters ended by a null character.

It is possible to use an 'end-sequenceof' with a count_ and length_ loop, but
the decode will fail if the last entry is not an end-sequenceof.

.. _null terminated string: `null-terminated-string`_

Greedy sequenceof
=================

A 'greedy' sequenceof doesn't have 'count', 'length', or 'end-sequenceof'
entries; it will continue to decode until all of the available data has been
decoded. If its child entry fails to decode while data is still available, the
sequenceof decoding fails.


Examples
========

A block of 100 name/value pairs::

  <sequenceof name="data" count="100">
    <sequence name="entry">
      <field name="name" length="64" type="text" />
      <field name="value" length="32" type="integer" encoding="little endian" />
    </sequence>
  </sequenceof>

.. _null-terminated-string:

A null terminated string is a repeated block of characters that
is terminated by a 'null' character. This can be represented by::

  <sequenceof name="null terminated string">
    <choice name="entry">
      <field name="null" length="8" value="0x0"><end-sequenceof /></field>
      <field name="char" length="8" />
    </choice>
  </sequenceof>

A repeated loop of entries that has a known length (eg: the header in the 
wma/wmv specification) can be defined as::

  <field name="buffer length" length="32" type="integer" />
  <sequenceof name="items" length="${buffer length} * 8">
    <sequence name="item">
      <field name="a" length="8" />
      <field name="b" length="16" />
    </sequence>
  </sequenceof>
