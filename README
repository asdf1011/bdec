'bdec', a set of tools for decoding binary files.


Overview
========

Writing decoders for binary formats is typically tedious and error prone.
Binary formats are usually specified in text documents that developers have
to read if they are to create decoders, a time consuming, frustrating, and
costly process.

While there are high level markup languages such as ASN.1 for specifying
formats, few specifications make use of these languages, and such markup
languages cannot be retro-fitted to existing binary formats. 'bdec' is an
attempt to specify arbitrary binary formats in a markup language, and create
decoders automatically for that binary format given the high level
specification.

Bdec can;

 * Allow specifications to be easily written, updated, and maintained.
 * Decode binary files directly from the specification.
 * Generate portable, readable, and efficient C decoders.
 * Run under Windows & Unix operating systems

The bdec xml specification uses constructs based loosely on those found in
ASN.1.


Getting started
===============

1. Download_ the latest version.
2. Go through the tutorial_.
3. Try writing a specification for your own file formats (referring to the
   documentation_ where necessary).
4. Save lots of time and pain by *not* writing and maintaining hand written 
   buggy decoders.


Documentation
=============

If you're just getting started, the tutorial_ takes you step by step through
the different concepts used in bdec. Once you've got started, refere to the
rest of the documentation_ as required.

.. _tutorial: docs/tutorial.html


Support
=======

Any comments or questions can go to the group mailing list at
`bdec-project@yahoogroups.com`_. This is a moderated list, so please be
patient if your question doesn't show up immediately.

Features
========

* It is easy to quickly write (and read) a specification
* No need to write a custom decoder (all error conditions are handled 
  internally; decoding either passes or fails).
* The command line application allows visual inspection of problematic files.
* Unicode aware, little-endian / big-endian aware
* Decode to xml for rapid development (eg: `xml representation of a fat
  bootsector`_)
* Specify fields down to the bit (eg: single bit flags)
* Generated decoders are human readable, easy to use, and compile without
  warnings.

License
=======

The bdec library and all decoders generated by the specification compiler
are available under the `GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)`_. In
summary, this means;

 * The decoders can be built and used in any application (including commercial
   closed source applications).
 * If used in a closed source application, the decoder must be dynamically
   linked (eg: .dll in Windows, .so in Linux).
 * The source code (and any modifications) to the decoder must be made
   available to anyone you distribute the decoder to.

Download
========

The easiest way to install bdec is to use python's easy_install_ application.
Run::

  easy_install bdec

to install the latest version of the bdec decoder and compiler. The source
code links below can be also be used if you install the dependencies manually
(currently pyparsing_ and mako_).

See the CHANGELOG_ for past releases.

Similar projects
================

Some projects that perform 'generic' binary decoding include;

* Hachoir_ - Very powerful decoding library, where binary formats are specified
  in python code (using generators). Quite high level decoding, with complex
  binary files being decoded. Lots of file formats are specified (at least
  partially).
* Construct_ - Decodes data structures, formats are specified in python code
  without too much high-level intelligence. Not many formats available.

Projects that generate decoders from high level specifications;

* Asn1c_ Asn.1 compiler; generates C language encoders and decoders.
* `Google protocol buffers`_ - Define file formats in an easy to read text
  specification, and compile them to Java, C++, or Python decoders and encoders.
