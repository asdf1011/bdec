# Each section is the name of a language / template, and each key is the name
# of a file without the extension (eg: xml/005_choice_hidden_child). The value
# should be;
#  * 'decode' to skip the test entirely for this language
#  * 'encode' if only the encoding portion of the test is to be skipped.
#  * 'encoding-equivalent' if the encoding succeeds, but generates different
#     binary data.
